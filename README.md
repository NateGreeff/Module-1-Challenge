# Marketing Agency Accessibility Enhancement Project

## Description

This project is a marketing agency's initiative to improve its web page's accessibility in order to optimize search engine results. The codebase has been revised to follow accessibility standards, ensuring the website is more efficient, effective, and accessible to a wider audience.

## User Story

I wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards to optimize the site for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

The website now meets the following acceptance criteria:

1. **Semantic HTML Elements**: The source code of the webpage utilizes semantic HTML elements. This means that the code describes the type of content it's presenting, providing both the browser and the developer a better understanding of its structure and meaning.

2. **Logical Structure**: The structure of the HTML elements follows a logical order independent of styling and positioning. This makes the webpage content more comprehensible and navigable, particularly for assistive technologies.

3. **Accessible Alt Attributes**: All image elements on the webpage have accessible alt attributes. These provide a text description of the image, which improves accessibility for people using screen readers or in cases where the image cannot be displayed.

4. **Sequential Heading Attributes**: The heading attributes on the webpage fall in sequential order. This order helps users, especially those using screen readers, understand and navigate the page content.

5. **Descriptive Title Element**: The title element of the webpage is concise and descriptive. This not only provides an overview of the webpage content, but also improves SEO and usability.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these principles of web accessibility, I'm confident that the site is now optimized for search engines, resulting in better visibility and user experience.
